		<h1>Evolution of Software Applications</h1>
		<p>The CLI (Command line interface) was the main use for all computers. To use the CLI the user must be familiar with the requirements of syntax and if you use windows machine you must have the >sign to use properly. Although when GUI (Graphical user interface) came out, it rapidly took the CLIs place in most computers.  CLIs only remained popular for the people who want to perform specialised or automatic tasks.
GUI was a theoretical possibility in the early 1970s. Researchers at Xerox during the 1970s made the concept for many of the basics for todayâ€™s GUI.

			Intellectual Property
		</h2>
		<p>Intellectual property (IP) refers to the ownership of an idea or design by the person who came up with it. It is a term used in property law. The most common types of intellectual property rights are copyrights, trademarks, patents and trade secrets.
The Intellectual Property (IP) is a term for any intangible asset - something proprietary that doesn't exist as a physical object but has value. Examples of intellectual property include designs, concepts, software, inventions, trade secrets, formulas and brand names, as well as works of art.
So for example, if you have an idea on this type of software and how to make it better and you hire someone to help you he cannot steal your idea and take it somewhere else or else he can be taken to court.
