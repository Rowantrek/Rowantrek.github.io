		<h1>Social Context of Software Design</h1>
		<h2>Ergonomics</h2>
		<p>Ergonomics is from the Greek word ergon meaning work, and nomoi meaning natural laws. Human characteristics, such as height, weight, and proportions are considered. Ergonomics is sometimes known as human factors engineering.
Computers and related products, such as computer desks and chairs, are frequently the focus of ergonomic design. A great number of people use these products for extended periods of time - such as the typical work day. If products like these are not designed properly and adjusted well for human use, the person using them may suffer unnecessary fatigue, stress, and even injury.
Software ergonomics is a subcategory of ergonomics that concerns the software design, rather than the hardware design, of systems. Software ergonomics includes the determination of user needs, interface design, user support and usability testing. Click on the buttons to the left to learn more about each of these areas of software ergonomics.

		<h2>
			Inclusivity
		</h2>
		<p>Inclusive software should take into consideration the different end users who will likely use the product. Software developers donâ€™t take into account though the different characteristics of users and thus are less likely to secure a significant part of the market share therefore less sales and less profit. When designing software solutions software developers take into account some characteristics that have straight up consequences for the design of the user interface.

Cultural background
Culture is what people describe as a way of living and has been set in over a long period of time. It is important to consider that when designing software.  A few examples are:
Names.
In western culture most people have christian names and a surname this however is not the case in most Asian cultures where they have a formal and informal name.
Numbers
Currency
Time zones
These are all examples of why one should study and test your software with lots of different people from different places of the world. The dominant language in the country should be the language that the software uses.

Visual disabilities 
By simply using larger fonts and having the option of scales (increasing  text sizes) is a quick and easy way to overcome this disability.

Hearing disabilities
Software should not rely on hearing as its only form of communication it should have other visual clues such as sub text. Software developers also should consider having sign language in there software ready for the use if he wishes to use it.

		<h2>Privacy</h2>
		<p>
		People us Privacy software to keep protect themselves private and secure. Personal information is any information that allows others to identify you. We need to know who holds our personal information and feel safe and comfortable but for that to happen we need our information to not be collected without us knowing or without our permission.
           	
Privacy software can refer to two different types of protection. One type is protecting a user's Internet privacy from the World Wide Web. There are software products that will mask or hide a user's IP address from the outside world in order to protect the user from identity theft. The second type of protection is hiding or deleting the users Internet traces that are left on their PC after they have been surfing the Internet. There is software that will erase all the users Internet traces and there is software that will hide and encrypt a user's traces so that others using their PC will not know where they have been surfing.
