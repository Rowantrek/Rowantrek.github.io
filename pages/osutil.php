		<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
		<p>An operating system is the most important and the lowest level program that runs on a computer. It controls hardware such as the CPU, Memory, Storage and Peripheral devices. It also acts as a middle man for hardware functions such as input, output, memory allocation and storage. It also manages the application processes and allocates them CPU, Memory and Storage. The three major desktop operating systems are; Windows (82.74%), macOS (13.23%) and Linux Distributions (1.57%).</p>

		<h1>Utility Software</h1>
		<p>Utility Software is a piece of software which lies between an operating system application and an application. It can come packaged with the operating system or can be packaged separately. Utility Software generally performs system functions such like checking for viruses, basic text-editing, file compression and storage defragmentation. Utility Software can also generally be used separately from the operating system. Another important utility software is embedded license counts.In large organisations or networks software is generally installed directly from installation files on a main server. Software exists to keep track of how many times the software has been installed and on how many computers it runs on. Batch job scheduling utility software also is another type of important utility software. They allow the user to schedule processes that are executed on a regular basis e.g. file scan, backups or defragmentation.</p>
